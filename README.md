## UX


### Website Goals

The purpose of the website is to provide tourists basic information about [Poprad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poprad) 
in Slovakia. The main feature of Google search map together recommended places of interest such as restaurants,
 patisseries, bars and attractions already populated on the map. From the many activities Poprad has to offer 
 the most popular ones are included on the site with links to corresponding websites for more information. 
 Another feature offered is sign up for the newsletter so the tourists can be notified about new activities and attractions.

### User Stories

* As a user of the site I want a site that is easy to navigate
* As a tourist I want  a website which shows some recommended 
activities and places to visit  so I don’t have to do too much 'Googling'
* As a user I want a site that has functional map with search 
option so I don’t have to switch between separate windows
* As a potential tourist or satisfied tourist I would like an option to receive 
news about uupcoming events and interesting activities
